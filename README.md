<h1>Template Matching using image processing</h1>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>Enhancing the template matching algorithm and making it rotation variant. This
means that if the templateâ€™s orientation is different from that of the region we
are trying to match, the enhanced algorithm will fix this problem.</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3> 
<p>Enhancing the template matching algorithm and making it  scale variant. This
means that if the template is smaller than the region we are trying to match, the
enhanced algorithm will fix this problem.</p>

<h3>Part 3</h3>
<p>Enhancing the template matching algorithm and making it able to detect all the areas
in the original image where the template is found. (Multi object detection). this
also  handles the case where we would state that the template has been
found nowhere in the original image</p>
